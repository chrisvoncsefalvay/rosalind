# My rosalind.info answers

These are my answers for the [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info) problems. They're not necessarily the best answers, but they're mine.

## Usage

Each problem has its own file. The file is named after the problem ID. For example, the problem ID for the first problem is `DNA`, so the file is named `dna.py`.

Each file is a standalone program. It can be run with the following command:

```bash
python3 DNA.py
```

It takes as its input the Rosalind download, which would be called `rosalind_dna.txt` in this case. The file is expected to be in the same directory as the script. It returns a directly uploadable response with the suffix "_solution", i.e. in this case, `dna_solution.txt`.
